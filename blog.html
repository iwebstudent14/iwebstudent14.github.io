                <h3>Week 5</h3>
                <div class="date">07/12/2019</div>
                <p>This week we learned about design patterns (e.g. image galleries, breadcrumb navs, modals, carousels,
                    slideshows, etc.). We then coded an custom UI image gallery of UI designs created in XD and custom
                    thumbnail images in created in Photoshop. We then added an overlay lightbox modal using Fancybox. We
                    also took photos around
                    campus and drew logo sketches of our initials.</p>

                <h3>Week 4</h3>
                <div class="date">07/05/2019</div>
                <p>This week I used Adobe XD to create sub pages that are linked together to form a multi-page
                    prototype. I also learned about different web design terms (e.g. IA, UX, and UI) and different
                    planning exercies and deliverables that one can create as part of the web design process, such as
                    site maps, wireframes, prototypes, and high-fidelity mockups. We also began planning for the final
                    project.</p>

                <h3>Week 3</h3>
                <div class="date">06/28/2019</div>
                <p>This week I learned how to use Photoshop to edit raster images. I also used Photoshop to clean up a
                    photo of a sketch that I drew that I then converted into a vector SVG using Adobe Illustrator. Then
                    I learned how to use Adobe XD to design a website without coding. I created a Home page,
                    About page, and a Blog page that closely resembles the site that I coded during the first 2 weeks of
                    class. I also learned how to create and share an interactive prototype using Adobe XD. Check out

                <h3>Week 2</h3>
                <div class="date">06/21/2019</div>
                <p>I deleted all of the the styling (CSS) that I did last week, and started adding in essential HTML and
                    CSS, such as common structural markup (e.g. header, nav, footer, etc.). I also created three
                    category-based lists as the content of my home page. I then created two sub pages: about.html and
                    blog.html. The About page contains links to the primary resources and technologies learned in this
                    class. The Blog page contains a brief summary of what I did in class each week. At the end of this
                    week, I had a live, working web site with three pages: <a
                        href="https://iwebstudent001.github.io/index.html">Home</a>, <a
                        href="https://iwebstudent001.github.io/about.html">About</a>, and <a
                        href="https://iwebstudent001.github.io/blog.html">Blog</a>.</p>

                <h3>Week 1</h3>
                <div class="date">06/14/2019</div>
                <p>I learned how to create a live website hosted on Github. I first logged into Github.com, then I
                    created a root username repository named <a
                        href="https://github.com/iwebstudent001/iwebstudent001.github.io">iwebstudent001.github.io</a>.
                    Next I used the Terminal app to
                    clone the repo to my local computer desktop (via CLI: git clone). Then I used a code editor named VS
                    Code to edit the readme file (in a language called Markdown). Then I created a index.html file (the
                    home page) along with a style.css file. At the end of each day, I save my changes (via git commit)
                    and upload them to the server (via git push). At the end of the week, I had a live, working web
                    site: <a href="https://iwebstudent001.github.io">https://iwebstudent001.github.io</a></p>
